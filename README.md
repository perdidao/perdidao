## About me

I'm a brazilian web developer based in SÃ£o SebastiÃ£o da Amoreira, ParanÃ¡, a pretty small town with only 8.5k citizens.  
I started my carrer working as a web designer back in 2010, then migrated to frontend development with the help of a friend/professor/boss.  
On my free time I generally stay with my two kids and on my free free time, I like to play online (mainly counter-strike).  

## Education

I'm a Advertisement and Marketing graduate with post-graduation courses on Multimedia Arts Direction (UNOPAR) and Web Development (UTFPR).  
I also have a MBA on Project management (SENAI).  

## Professional experience

My current stack is heavy on React with typescript and Nextjs, but sometimes I need to work on PHP and even Go.  
I worked with a lot of different technologies on the past, like: Vuejs, Nuxtjs, Emberjs, Electron, React Native, Flutter, Thymeleaf, Wordpress, Woocommerce, Backbonejs with Marionette, Magento and others.  
I also have experience on design tools like Photoshop, Sketch, Figma and Illustrator.  
  
I've worked with on companies with a lot of clients from different areas, going from brazilian singers and bands, through non-governamental institutions like ONU, to big companies across the globe like Mc Donald's, Samsung, etc. I also worked on web, desktop and mobile apps.
